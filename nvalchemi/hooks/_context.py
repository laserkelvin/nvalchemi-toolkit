        Model being used (if applicable).
    global_rank : int
        Distributed rank of this process.

    ----------

        Current optimizer step number on this worker.
    global_step_count : int
        Current optimizer step number across all data-parallel workers.
    batch_count : int
        Number of training batches consumed, including batches whose
        optimizer step was skipped by update hooks.
    epoch_step_count : int
        Number of batches consumed within the current training epoch.

    loss : torch.Tensor | None
        Aggregate loss for the current step.
    losses : dict[str, torch.Tensor] | None
        Named loss components for the current step.
    models : dict[str, BaseModelMixin] | ModuleDict | None
        Models participating in the training step; this differs
        from the ``model`` attribute which is intended to
        represent a 'main' model in multi-model workflows. The
        key/model mapping should be semantic, e.g. 'student' and
        'teacher' in distillation workflows, with 'student' being
        the intended 'main' model.
    optimizers : list[torch.optim.Optimizer]
        Optimizers participating in the training step. Empty when no
        optimizer is attached (e.g. eval-only or manually-driven hook
        contexts); ``TrainingUpdateOrchestrator`` and similar consumers
        treat an empty list as a no-op.
    lr_schedulers : list[torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler | None]
        Learning rate schedulers participating in the training step.
        Aligned positionally with ``optimizers`` when populated; entries
        may be ``None`` when an optimizer has no scheduler. Empty when no
        scheduler is attached.
    gradients : dict[str, torch.Tensor] | None
        Parameter gradients for the current step.
    grad_scaler : torch.amp.GradScaler | None
        AMP gradient scaler for mixed-precision training; ``None`` when
        AMP is not in use.
    validation : dict[str, Any] | None
        Latest validation summary produced by the training strategy's
        validation checkpoint (``TrainingStrategy.validate()``).
        ``None`` until validation has run or after the latest summary is
        consumed by metric-driven schedulers. In distributed runs, the reduced
        summary is available on every rank.

    One context instance spans a single
    :meth:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomGenerator.sample` call: the same
    object is dispatched at every
    :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.stages.GenerationStage` and the
    :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomGenerator` re-reads it after each
    dispatch, so hooks mutate generation state by *replacing* context fields
    (``ctx.batch = ctx.batch[keep]``), not by editing in place.

    Attributes
    ----------
    batch : Batch | TensorDict | None
        The single canonical batch for this call. Built by conditioning
        (tiled by ``num_samples_per_batch``), read by the generating
        function, and materialized into the generated
        :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` before ``AFTER_GENERATE`` hooks fire.
        There is deliberately no separate ``cond_batch`` — conditioning
        writes the same field that materialization replaces. Widened from
        :attr:`~nvalchemi.hooks.HookContext.batch` to admit
        :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` conditioning for non-graph-native
        families; from ``AFTER_GENERATE`` on it always holds a ``Batch``.
    cond : Any
        The conditioning input for the current call — a tensor container
        (``Batch``, ``TensorDict``, ...) with text or other raw modalities
        already encoded. Editable at ``BEFORE_CONDITION``.
    intermediates : dict[str, Any]
        Scratch space for hook-to-hook state within one call (e.g. a
        conditioning embedding computed at ``AFTER_CONDITION`` and consumed
        at ``AFTER_GENERATE``).
    step_count : int
    step_count : int
        Which generation call this is within a stream; ``0`` for a one-shot
        call. Drives hook frequency gating.
    sample : Any
        The raw sample for this call, set when the generating function
        returns and exposed to hooks at ``AFTER_SAMPLE``; the driver re-reads
        it after that dispatch and hands it to the materialization callable,
        and it stays populated through ``AFTER_GENERATE``. A
        :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` for tensor-native families; otherwise
        any container the materialization callable understands.
    accepted_mask : torch.Tensor | None
        Boolean mask recording which of the call's candidates were accepted,
        written by filtering hooks or the materialization callable. ``None``
        when acceptance has not been recorded for this dispatch. Mirrors the
        :attr:`~nvalchemi.hooks.DynamicsContext.converged_mask` convention so
        acceptance-aware reporting and resampling loops have a stable
        channel.

    Attributes
    ----------
    batch : Batch
        Current batch being processed.
    step_count : int
        Current step number in the workflow.
    model : BaseModelMixin | None
        Maps to the ``main`` model if it's presen in ``models``.
        ``None`` when no primary model is registered.
    models : dict[str, BaseModelMixin]
        Named models visible to hooks. Training strategies populate this for
        multi-model workflows. The ``"main"`` key is the only primary model
        used by the ``model`` alias; single-model and dynamics code can pass
        ``model=...`` to populate that key.
    loss : torch.Tensor | None
        Total scalar loss value produced by the training step. When
        ``losses`` is populated, this equals ``losses["total_loss"]``; see
        ``losses`` for the per-component breakdown.
    losses : ComposedLossOutput | None
        Per-component loss contributions produced by a ComposedLossFunction.
        Populated by training strategies from AFTER_LOSS onward so hooks can
        log or monitor individual loss terms without re-running the loss
        forward pass. Tensors are autograd-connected through BEFORE_BACKWARD,
        then detached from AFTER_BACKWARD onward. ``None`` for non-training
        contexts (e.g. dynamics). Hooks must not retain live tensors across
        steps, and calling ``.item()`` on CUDA tensors forces a host-device
        sync.
    optimizer : torch.optim.Optimizer | None
        Optimizer being used (training only).
    lr_scheduler : object | None
        Learning rate scheduler (training only).
    gradients : dict[str, torch.Tensor] | None
        Parameter gradients (training only).
    converged_mask : torch.Tensor | None
        Boolean mask of converged samples (dynamics only).
    epoch : int | None
        Current epoch number (training only).
    global_rank : int
        Distributed rank of this process.
    workflow : Any
        Back-reference to the engine running the hooks (e.g. a
        ``BaseDynamics`` instance).  ``None`` when the workflow does
        not inject itself.

"""Composable :class:`torch.nn.Module`-based loss-function abstractions.

Leaf loss terms are tensor-to-tensor :class:`BaseLossFunction` instances
whose :meth:`~BaseLossFunction.forward` returns the raw, unweighted loss
tensor. :class:`ComposedLossFunction` owns the per-component weighting
(either floats or :class:`LossWeightSchedule` instances) and, by default,
normalizes the resolved weights so they sum to ``1.0`` at every call.
This keeps weight scheduling a *relative* knob and leaves the learning
rate as the sole *absolute* magnitude control.

    This class owns the per-component weighting — leaves are weightless.
    Weights may be plain floats or :class:`LossWeightSchedule` instances;
    they are resolved to floats at call time. By default the resolved
    weights are normalized to sum to ``1.0`` so scheduling controls
    *relative* contributions while the learning rate controls the
    absolute loss magnitude. Opt out with ``normalize_weights=False``.

    Components live in an :class:`torch.nn.ModuleList` for
    ``.modules()`` / ``.state_dict()`` / nested-``__repr__`` support.
    When a component is itself a :class:`ComposedLossFunction`, its
    components and weights are flattened into the parent element-wise so
    ``(A + B) + C`` is equivalent to ``A + B + C``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    components
        Loss terms to combine; must contain at least one element.
    weights
        Optional per-component weights. When provided, ``weights`` must
        have the same length as ``components`` at construction time
        (i.e. top-level components — child weights inside nested
        compositions are multiplied element-wise by the parent weight
        during flattening). A ``None`` entry is shorthand for ``1.0``,
        so ``weights=[None, 2.0, None]`` means "component 1 gets 2×,
        others default". Passing ``weights=None`` defaults every
        component to ``1.0``.
    normalize_weights
        When ``True`` (default), resolved weights are divided by their
        sum at each call so the effective weights sum to ``1.0``. A
        zero-sum raises :class:`ValueError`. When ``False``, raw
        weighted sums are returned.

    Attributes
    ----------
    components

class TrainingStage(Enum):
    """Stages of the training lifecycle at which hooks can fire.

    Parallel to :class:`nvalchemi.dynamics.base.DynamicsStage`, this enum
    marks the points before and after each operation in a training run.
    Members are paired ``BEFORE_*`` / ``AFTER_*`` around each lifecycle
    event, from the once-per-run ``BEFORE_TRAINING`` / ``AFTER_TRAINING``
    outer pair down to the per-batch forward, loss, backward, and
    optimizer-step phases.

    Attributes
    ----------
    BEFORE_TRAINING : TrainingStage
        Fires once before the epoch loop, after the model is on device
        and optimizers are constructed.
    BEFORE_EPOCH : TrainingStage
        Fires at the start of each epoch, before the first batch.
    BEFORE_BATCH : TrainingStage
        Fires at the start of each batch, after gradients are zeroed.
    BEFORE_FORWARD : TrainingStage
        Fires before the model forward pass.
    AFTER_FORWARD : TrainingStage
        Fires after the model forward pass; predictions are available.
    BEFORE_LOSS : TrainingStage
        Fires before the loss computation.
    AFTER_LOSS : TrainingStage
        Fires after the loss computation; the loss tensor is populated.
    BEFORE_BACKWARD : TrainingStage
        Fires before the backward pass; typical slot for loss scaling.
    AFTER_BACKWARD : TrainingStage
        Fires after the backward pass and before the optimizer step;
        typical slot for gradient clipping or gradient-norm logging.
    BEFORE_OPTIMIZER_STEP : TrainingStage
        Fires immediately before the optimizer step; typical slot for
        gradient unscaling.
    AFTER_OPTIMIZER_STEP : TrainingStage
        Fires after the optimizer step; typical slot for LR-scheduler
        step, EMA update, and post-step logging.
    AFTER_BATCH : TrainingStage
        Fires at the end of each batch.
    AFTER_EPOCH : TrainingStage
        Fires at the end of each epoch, after the last batch.
    AFTER_TRAINING : TrainingStage
        Fires once after the final epoch.

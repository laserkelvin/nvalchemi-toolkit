"""Composable model composition.

:class:`ComposableModelWrapper` combines two or more
:class:`~nvalchemi.models.base.BaseModelMixin`-compatible models whose
composable outputs (energies, forces, stresses) are summed element-wise.
Non-composable outputs produced by sub-models are written back to the batch
on a last-write-wins basis.

Typical usage via the ``+`` operator (when models support it)::

    combined = model_a + model_b

Or directly::

    from nvalchemi.models.composable import ComposableModelWrapper

    combined = ComposableModelWrapper(lj_model, mlip_model)
    combined.model_config.compute_stresses = True

The composite model synthesises a :class:`~nvalchemi.models.base.ModelCard`
from all sub-model cards, picking the most permissive neighbor configuration
(maximum cutoff, full list, MATRIX if any sub-model uses MATRIX).

        Coordinate (sparse) format.  Neighbors are stored as an ``edge_index``

        This is the conventional format used by most GNN-based MLIPs.

        Dense neighbor-matrix format.  Neighbors are stored as a
        ``neighbor_matrix`` tensor of shape ``[N, max_neighbors]`` (global
        atom indices) together with a ``num_neighbors`` tensor of shape
        ``[N]``.  Used by Warp interaction kernels (e.g. Lennard-Jones) that

class BaseModelMixin(abc.ABC):
    """
    Abstract MixIn class providing a homogenized interface for wrapper models
    from external machine learning interatomic potential projects.

    This mixin defines the core interface that all external model wrappers
    should implement to ensure consistency across different model types.

    The mixin provides abstract methods for:
    - Computing embeddings at different graph levels
    - Predicting energies and forces
    - Defining expected output shapes
    - Adapting inputs and outputs between framework and external model formats

    A concrete implementation of this mixin should utilize the following
    functions to implement predictions:
    - `_adapt_input`, which adapts the input batch to the model's expected format
    - `_adapt_output`, which adapts the model's output to the framework's expected format
    - `validate_batch`, which ensures that the input batch is compatible with the model
    - `compute_embeddings`, which computes embeddings at different graph levels

    The mixin also defines several properties that must be implemented to specify
    model capabilities; when adding a new model, these properties must be implemented.
    - `model_card`: Pydantic model that contains information about the model's
      capabilities and requirements
    - `embedding_shapes`: Expected shapes of node, edge, and graph embeddings

    The workflow for using this mixin is:

    1. Implement all required properties to specify model capabilities
    2. Implement ``_adapt_input`` to convert framework data to model format
    3. Implement ``parse_output`` to convert model output to framework format
    4. Implement prediction methods based on supported capabilities
    5. Use ``validate_batch`` to ensure input compatibility
    6. Call ``parse_output`` to write model outputs to the ``Batch`` data structure

    Raises

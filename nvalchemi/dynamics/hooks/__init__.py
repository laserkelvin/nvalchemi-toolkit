Dynamics hooks for observation, safety, and behavior modification.

This sub-package provides concrete hook implementations that plug into the
:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics` hook system.  Every class
satisfies the :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.Hook` protocol and can be
registered with any dynamics engine via
:meth:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics.register_hook`.

Hooks are organized into the following modules:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - :mod:`snapshot`
     - Save batch state to a :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks.DataSink`.
   * - :mod:`logging`
     - Log scalar observables (energy, temperature, fmax, etc.).
   * - :mod:`safety`
     - Numerical safety guards (NaN detection, force clamping).
   * - :mod:`monitors`
     - Long-running diagnostic monitors (energy drift).
   * - :mod:`periodic`
     - Periodic boundary condition utilities (coordinate wrapping).
   * - :mod:`bias`
     - Biased potential hooks for enhanced sampling workflows.
   * - :mod:`profiling`
     - Performance profiling and step timing.

The internal base classes :class:`_ObserverHook` and :class:`_PostComputeHook`
reduce boilerplate for common hook categories but are not part of the public
API.

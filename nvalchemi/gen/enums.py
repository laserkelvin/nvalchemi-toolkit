"""Modality and intent enums for the toolkit-level generative API.

The enums here describe *what* a generative model produces (its
modalities) and *how* it is used (its intents). They are deliberately
generic. ``Modality`` enumerates the artifact kinds a
generative model may ingest or emit; ``GenerativeIntent`` enumerates the
operational roles a model can play. A
:class:`~nvalchemi.models.gen.base.GenerativeModelConfig` binds a set of
intents to the modalities each intent operates on.

    Attributes
    ----------
    POINT_CLOUD
        An unordered set of atoms without connectivity (coordinates + numbers).
    GRAPH
        An atomic graph with explicit edges (a neighbor list).
    PERIODIC
        A periodic structure: atoms plus a lattice/cell and periodicity flags.
        Not necessarily crystalline — defects, disorder, and surfaces qualify.
    TEXT
        A text / SMILES / string conditioning artifact.
    SPECTRA
        A one-dimensional spectroscopic or signal artifact.
    EMBEDDING
        A dense latent embedding artifact.

        A gridded image artifact.

        Connect two artifacts (e.g. embed two modalities into a shared space).

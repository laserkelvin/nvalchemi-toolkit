"""Batched generative inference driven by a user-supplied callable.

``AtomisticGenerator`` (the *driver* throughout this module) wraps your generation
code — a function, or a callable object holding the trained model — and runs
a fixed pipeline per call: optionally condition the inputs, generate, and
return a :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch`. Any sampling procedure works
(diffusion, flow matching, GANs, VAEs, search loops); the callable owns the
model and does the sampling.

The pipeline per :meth:`AtomisticGenerator.sample` looks like::

    # condition step — only when a condition callable is provided:
    BEFORE_CONDITION   hooks  (edit or replace ctx.inputs)
    ctx.inputs = condition(ctx.inputs, num_samples=..., rng=...)
    AFTER_CONDITION    hooks  (replace what the function is called with)
    # generation and mapping:
    ctx.sample = generator_func(ctx.inputs, num_samples=..., rng=...)
    if isinstance(ctx.sample, Batch):   # the Batch path:
        ctx.batch = ctx.sample
        AFTER_GENERATE hooks (filtering = subsetting ctx.batch)
        return ctx.batch
    return ctx.sample      # any other container passes through as-is

Conditioning is optional: pass ``condition_func``, or set a ``condition``
attribute on the generating function, to transform inputs before generation.
It prepares the request — what the procedure is asked to do — it does not
constrain what comes out (output constraints live in guidance, rejection
hooks, or pipeline stages). With neither, the inputs reach the function
untouched and the ``BEFORE_CONDITION``/``AFTER_CONDITION`` stages do not
fire.

Hooks registered at the
:class:`~nvalchemi.gen.stages.GenerationStage` points receive one shared
:class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.GenerationContext` per call and mutate it by
replacing its fields; the driver re-reads the context after each dispatch.
Hooks run in list order at each stage, and a raising hook aborts the call.
See the stage enum for what may change where and when each stage fires.
Hooks reach the procedure via ``ctx.workflow.generator_func``;
``ctx.model`` is always ``None`` — the driver has no model field.

The defaults chain
------------------
Every cross-cutting knob resolves the same way: an explicit driver argument
wins, then the generating function's attribute, then the module default.

* conditioning: ``condition_func`` > ``generator_func.condition`` > ``None``
  (no condition step; the inputs pass through untouched).
* field declarations: constructor ``required_inputs`` / ``outputs`` >
  ``generator_func``'s attributes > ``None`` (undeclared;
  :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.pipeline.GenerationPipeline` validation fails fast).
* device: ``device`` > ``generator_func.device`` > ``None`` (no stream, no
  device-residency check, CPU session RNG).

Materialization is the function's own, and the output contract is a
:class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch`: the driver fires the ``AFTER_GENERATE``
hooks on it, validates it, and pipelines compose it (including driving
dynamics). A function may return any other container, but then
``sample()`` passes it through untouched: no ``AFTER_GENERATE`` hooks, and
no feeding dynamics stages.

Examples
--------
A GAN, one forward pass, returning a batch directly::

    def gan_generate(inputs=None, *, num_samples=1, rng=None, **kwargs):
        z = torch.randn(num_samples, latent_dim, generator=rng)
        positions = decode(z).reshape(num_samples, num_atoms, 3)
        numbers = torch.full((num_atoms,), 6)
        return Batch.from_data_list(
            [AtomicData(positions=x, atomic_numbers=numbers) for x in positions]
        )

    gan = AtomisticGenerator(generator_func=gan_generate)

Model-owning procedures — a callable object carries the model (plus
``device`` and field declarations the driver reads as defaults); the tests
and examples ship such objects::

    gen = AtomisticGenerator(generator_func=GANGenerate(gan_model))

Streaming — one ``sample()`` call per input item; ``None`` means repeated
unconditional draws (an infinite stream unless capped)::

    for batch in gen.stream(None, max_batches=10):
        ...

Composition — sequential pipelines mirror the dynamics ``|`` sugar
(:class:`~nvalchemi.gen.pipeline.GenerationPipeline`)::

    pipe = gen_a | gen_b
    out = pipe(inputs)

Sessions: streams, RNG, and compile — the driver is a context manager.
Entering a session (``with gen:``) creates a dedicated CUDA stream when the
resolved device is CUDA (unless ``dedicated_stream=False``), seeds a
session-scoped :class:`torch.Generator` (advanced per draw), compiles the
generating function when ``compile_generate`` is set, and opens
context-manager hooks; exiting unwinds all of it::

    with gen.compile():
        for batch in gen.stream(inputs):
            ...

    """Callable that encapsulates a family-specific generation strategy.

    A :class:`GeneratingFunction` owns everything generation needs —
    including the model, when there is one (held as a closure or an
    attribute of a callable object) — samples from it, and returns the
    generated artifact.

    Conditioning may live inside the function, or as a ``condition``
    attribute the driver calls before generation (see below); with neither,
    the inputs pass through untouched as the first positional argument.

    ``num_samples`` semantics are the function's own (per-conditioning-entry
    draws vs an unconditional total); the driver passes its ``num_samples``
    straight through.

    ``rng`` is ``None`` unless the driver has a ``seed``, a session, or a
    per-call ``rng=`` — handle ``None`` (torch sampling ops accept it).
    Outside a session the resolved RNG is CPU-resident even when generating
    on CUDA; inside a session it lives on the resolved device. When you draw
    on a device, make sure the generator matches it (e.g.
    ``torch.randn(..., generator=rng, device=...)``).

    Return a :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch`: that is the output contract.
    The driver fires the ``AFTER_GENERATE`` hooks on it, validates its device
    and declared ``outputs``, and pipelines compose it (including
    driving dynamics on it). Any other container is a fallback with real
    losses: ``sample()`` passes it through untouched, the ``AFTER_GENERATE``
    hooks are skipped, and it cannot feed dynamics stages. Inside the
    function, a :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` survives ``torch.compile``
    where arbitrary containers graph-break under ``compile_generate``;
    convert it to a ``Batch`` before returning.
    Library-native sampling loops (e.g. PhysicsNeMo diffusion samplers) plug
    in through a thin adapter with this signature.

    **Optional attributes.** A callable object (rather than a plain function)
    may carry attributes the :class:`AtomisticGenerator` reads as defaults when
    the driver does not set them explicitly:

    - ``condition`` — a :class:`ConditionFunction` mapping the call's raw
      inputs to the conditioned value the function is then called with
      (e.g. tiling a conditioning :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` so each
      graph gets ``num_samples`` draws). The driver runs it between the
      ``BEFORE_CONDITION`` and ``AFTER_CONDITION`` dispatches, which fire
      only when a condition step is provided; an explicit driver
      ``condition_func`` takes precedence over this attribute. There is no
      default condition: functions implement their own per use case, binding
      any extra context in their closure.
    - ``device`` — a :class:`torch.device` (or parseable device string),
      used when the driver's ``device`` is unset.
    - ``required_inputs`` / ``outputs`` — batch-field declarations,
      used when the driver does not pass them at construction.

    optionally materialize to a :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    generator_func
        The :class:`GeneratingFunction` driving generation. Required; the
        function owns the model when there is one.
    condition_func
        Optional :class:`ConditionFunction` run before generation: maps the
        call's raw inputs to the conditioned value the generating function is
        then called with. It prepares the request — it does not constrain
        what comes out. Takes precedence over the generating function's own
        ``condition`` attribute. When neither is provided, no conditioning
        happens — the inputs pass through untouched and the
        ``BEFORE_CONDITION``/``AFTER_CONDITION`` stages do not fire.
    device
        Optional device pin (``"cpu"``, ``"cuda"``, ``"cuda:0"``, or a
        :class:`torch.device`). Validated at construction: ``cpu`` always
        passes; ``cuda[:i]`` requires :func:`torch.cuda.is_available` and an
        in-range index. When unset, the generating function's ``device``
        attribute is used; when neither is present, no device resolves and no
        stream or device-residency check applies.
    dedicated_stream
        When ``True`` (default), entering a session creates a dedicated CUDA
        stream if the resolved device is CUDA. When ``False``, no stream is
        created even then.
    hooks
        Generation hooks, each with a :class:`GenerationStage` ``stage``.
        Validated at registration; see :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.HookRegistryMixin`.
        Serialized as attribute-faithful class specs (each ``__init__``
        parameter read back from the same-named attribute).
    required_inputs
        Batch fields this generator's input reads (empty means
        unconditional). Defaults from the generating function's
        ``required_inputs`` attribute; required by
        :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.pipeline.GenerationPipeline` for link
        validation.
    outputs
        Batch fields this generator's output carries (written or forwarded).
        Defaults from the generating function's ``outputs`` attribute.
    num_samples
        Independent draws requested per call, passed straight through to the
        generating function (per-entry vs total-draw semantics are the
        function's own). Per-call override via :meth:`sample`'s
        ``num_samples`` keyword.
    seed
        Optional base seed. Inside a session (``with gen:``) one
        :class:`torch.Generator` is seeded at entry and advanced per draw;
        outside a session each call derives
        ``torch.Generator().manual_seed(seed + step_count)``. A per-call
        ``rng=`` kwarg overrides both.
    step_count
        Runtime counter of generation calls — incremented in a ``finally``,
        so failed calls count too. Drives hook frequency gating. Excluded from
        serialization.
    compile_generate
        Compile the generating function with ``torch.compile`` — immediately
        via :meth:`compile`, or lazily at session entry. Default ``False``.
    compile_kwargs
        Keyword arguments forwarded to ``torch.compile``.

            conditioned result; otherwise the input is forwarded untouched.
        num_samples
            Per-call override for :attr:`num_samples`, passed straight
            through to the generating function.
        **kwargs
            Per-call options forwarded to the generating function (e.g.
            ``mask`` for inpainting). One reserved kwarg, ``rng=``, is
            consumed by ``sample`` itself to override the session/seeded RNG
            for this call.

        Returns
        -------
        Any
            The generating function's output: a
            :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` on the contract path —
            ``AFTER_GENERATE`` hooks have run (post-filter, so possibly with
            fewer graphs than were sampled), and the device and declared-field
            checks passed. A zero-graph ``Batch`` (built via
            :meth:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch.empty`) passes through as-is
            (subsetting a batch to zero graphs still raises ``IndexError``).
            Any other container forfeits the ``Batch`` machinery: returned
            untouched, ``AFTER_GENERATE`` hooks skipped, and it cannot feed
            dynamics stages in a pipeline.

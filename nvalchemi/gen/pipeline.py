"""Sequential composition of generators and other batch-processing stages.

A :class:`GenerationPipeline` is a thin orchestrator: it folds a
conditioning input through an ordered list of stages — generators, dynamics
engines, or any ``Batch -> Batch`` callable — mirroring the dynamics
``|`` sugar (:meth:`nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics.__or__` builds a
``DistributedPipeline``; here ``AtomisticGenerator.__or__`` builds a
``GenerationPipeline``).

Example
-------
::

    pipe = gen_a | gen_b | optimizer
    out = pipe(inputs)                    # one fold through the stages
    for batch in pipe.stream(inputs):     # lazy per-item fold
        ...

Semantics:

* **Stage 1 consumes the user's ``inputs``** (its generating function owns
  conditioning); every later stage maps Batch → Batch.
* **1→1 cardinality** per stage: filters may shrink a batch; nothing fans
  out. (A filter may not shrink a batch to *empty* today —
  :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` raises ``IndexError`` on zero-graph
  selections; empty-batch support is a separate data-layer decision.)
* **Empty batches short-circuit** (defensive contract): should a stage ever
  yield a zero-graph batch, remaining stages are skipped for that item and
  the empty batch is returned as-is. No shipped path currently produces one.
* **Mapping-less generators are terminal-only**: an AtomisticGenerator without a
  ``batch_mapping`` yields its raw sample (not necessarily a
  :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch`), so it can only be the last stage — every
  upstream stage must produce a ``Batch``.
* **Per-stage hooks**: each :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomisticGenerator`
  stage keeps its own hooks and
  :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.GenerationContext`; the pipeline passes only
  the batch between stages.
* **Sessions and compile**: ``with pipe:`` creates one dedicated CUDA
  stream (when the first AtomisticGenerator stage's resolved device is CUDA)
  shared by every AtomisticGenerator stage that opts in — sequential stages
  serialize on it with no cross-stream sync. :meth:`compile` compiles each
  AtomisticGenerator stage's generating function (non-AtomisticGenerator stages are
  skipped); there is no whole-fold compile, since the Batch
  plumbing between stages would graph-break for no real capture.

    Attributes
    ----------
    stages
        Ordered pipeline stages: :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomisticGenerator`
        instances, dynamics engines, or ``Batch -> Batch`` callables.

    Notes
    -----
    **Field-contract validation.** Every ``AtomisticGenerator`` stage must declare
    ``consumes_fields`` / ``produces_fields`` (set on the AtomisticGenerator directly
    or defaulted from the generating function's attributes); construction
    raises otherwise. For each adjacent AtomisticGenerator → AtomisticGenerator link,
    the downstream stage's ``consumes_fields`` must be covered by the upstream
    stage's
    (AIMNet2 ``charges`` → Ewald) applied to generation. Authors of custom
    ``batch_mapping`` callables own keeping their stage's declaration in sync
    with what the callable actually writes. Non-AtomisticGenerator stages carry no
    declarations and are not validated (their outputs are unknown at
    construction).

    The first stage's ``consumes_fields`` describe its *conditioning* input
    and are not validated (the pipeline cannot know what a user's ``inputs``
    carries).

    **Sessions and compile.** ``GenerationPipeline`` is a context manager:
    entry creates one dedicated CUDA stream (when the first
    :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomisticGenerator` stage's resolved device
    is CUDA) and shares it with every AtomisticGenerator stage that has
    ``dedicated_stream`` set, then enters each AtomisticGenerator stage's own
    session (session RNG, lazy compile, context-manager hooks).
    Non-AtomisticGenerator stages manage their own contexts.

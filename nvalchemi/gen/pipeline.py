"""Sequential composition of generators and other batch-processing stages.

A :class:`GenerationPipeline` is a thin orchestrator: it folds a
conditioning input through an ordered list of stages — generators, dynamics
engines, or any ``Batch -> Batch`` callable — mirroring the dynamics
``|`` sugar (:meth:`nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics.__or__` builds a
``DistributedPipeline``; here ``AtomisticGenerator.__or__`` builds a
``GenerationPipeline``).

Example
-------
::

    pipe = gen_a | gen_b | optimizer
    out = pipe(inputs)                    # one fold through the stages
    for batch in pipe.stream(inputs):     # lazy per-item fold
        ...

Semantics:

* **Stage 1 consumes the user's ``inputs``** (its generating function owns
  conditioning); every later stage maps Batch → Batch.
* **1→1 cardinality** per stage: filters may shrink a batch; nothing fans
  out. (A filter may not shrink a batch to *empty* today —
  :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` raises ``IndexError`` on zero-graph
  selections; empty-batch support is a separate data-layer decision.)
* **Empty batches short-circuit** (defensive contract): should a stage ever
  yield a zero-graph batch, remaining stages are skipped for that item and
  the empty batch is returned as-is. No shipped path currently produces one.
* **Non-``Batch`` outputs are terminal-only**: a generating function returning
  a non-``Batch`` container passes it through raw, so such a stage can only
  be last (or feed plain callables); a dynamics stage fed a non-``Batch``
  raises ``TypeError`` at the boundary (skipped under ``torch.compile``).
* **Per-stage hooks**: each :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomisticGenerator`
  stage keeps its own hooks and
  :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.GenerationContext`; the pipeline passes only
  the batch between stages.
* **Sessions and compile**: ``with pipe:`` creates one dedicated CUDA
  stream (when the first AtomisticGenerator stage's resolved device is CUDA)
  shared by every AtomisticGenerator stage that opts in — sequential stages
  serialize on it with no cross-stream sync. :meth:`compile` compiles each
  AtomisticGenerator stage's generating function (non-AtomisticGenerator stages are
  skipped); there is no whole-fold compile, since the Batch
  plumbing between stages would graph-break for no real capture.

    Attributes
    ----------
    stages
        Ordered pipeline stages: :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomisticGenerator`
        instances, dynamics engines, or ``Batch -> Batch`` callables.

    Notes
    -----
    **Field-contract validation.** Every ``AtomisticGenerator`` stage must declare
    ``required_inputs`` / ``outputs`` (set on the AtomisticGenerator directly
    or defaulted from the generating function's attributes); construction
    raises otherwise. For each adjacent AtomisticGenerator → AtomisticGenerator link,
    the downstream stage's ``required_inputs`` must be covered by the upstream
    stage's ``outputs``: the dynamics link contract
    (AIMNet2 ``charges`` → Ewald) applied to generation. Authors of custom
    generating functions own keeping their stage's declaration in sync with
    what the function actually writes. Non-AtomisticGenerator stages carry no
    declarations and are not validated (their outputs are unknown at
    construction).

    The first stage's ``required_inputs`` describe its *conditioning* input
    and are not validated (the pipeline cannot know what a user's ``inputs``
    carries).

    **Sessions and compile.** ``GenerationPipeline`` is a context manager:
    entry creates one dedicated CUDA stream (when the first
    :class:`~nvalchemi.gen.generator.AtomisticGenerator` stage's resolved device
    is CUDA) and shares it with every stage that follows the ``_stream``
    convention — AtomisticGenerator stages with ``dedicated_stream`` set,
    and any other stage that accepts a pre-set stream (dynamics engines and
    fused stages honor it) — then enters each stage's own session.

    **Stage calling convention.** A stage with a ``run`` method (a dynamics
    engine or a fused stage) is driven to completion with
    ``stage.run(batch, **kwargs)`` — its own hooks fire inside its loop.
    Any other stage is called as ``stage(batch, **kwargs)``. A dynamics
    stage must carry its own exit criterion (convergence or ``n_steps``);
    the fold offers no step budget of its own.

Pressure-Controlled (NPT) Molecular Dynamics
=============================================

The NPT ensemble keeps temperature **T** and pressure **P** constant while
letting the simulation cell fluctuate in response to the instantaneous
virial stress.  This is the correct ensemble for studying phase transitions,
equations of state, and crystal relaxations under applied pressure.

nvalchemi implements the Martyna-Tobias-Klein (MTK) barostat coupled to a
Nosé-Hoover chain (NHC) thermostat.  The equations of motion for both
particles and the cell matrix are integrated simultaneously, giving dynamics
that sample the NPT distribution to within finite-timestep corrections.

Key concepts:

* **Variable cell**: the simulation box ``cell`` (a 3×3 matrix) evolves as a
  dynamical variable.  Its time derivative is proportional to the mismatch
  between the instantaneous pressure tensor and the target pressure.
* **Thermostat time** ``tau_T``: controls how tightly temperature is coupled.
  Larger values give softer coupling and longer autocorrelation times.
* **Barostat time** ``tau_P``: controls cell relaxation speed.  Too small
  causes high-frequency cell oscillations; too large slows equilibration.
* **Stress requirement**: the model must return a ``"stress"`` tensor
  (shape ``[B, 3, 3]``).  For the LJ wrapper, set
  ``model.model_config.compute_stresses = True`` **before** creating the
  dynamics object.

Units note: pressure is in eV/Å³.  1 GPa ≈ 0.00624 eV/Å³.  This example
uses P = 0.0 (zero-pressure isobaric run).

# the model output, which the NPT barostat reads each step to compute the
# instantaneous pressure tensor.

# Building a periodic argon crystal for NPT
# ------------------------------------------
# NPT requires a few ingredients beyond a standard NVT setup:
#
# * ``cell`` — the initial simulation box (shape ``[1, 3, 3]`` for a single
#   system).  The NPT integrator will update this tensor each step.
# * ``pbc`` — periodic boundary conditions, must be ``True`` in all three
#   directions for an isotropic barostat.
# * ``stress`` — an initial stress tensor (shape ``[1, 3, 3]``) so that
#   ``batch.stress`` exists before the first model call.  The model
#   overwrites it in-place; the zeros here are just a placeholder.
# * ``velocities`` — node-level velocities needed by the kinetic energy
#   and thermostat kernels.

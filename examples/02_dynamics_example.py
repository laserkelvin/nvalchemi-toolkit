FIRE Optimization and FusedStage (FIRE + Langevin): Dynamics Demo
==================================================================

This example walks through two use cases of the :mod:`nvalchemi.dynamics`
framework, following the same pattern shown in
:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.demo.DemoDynamics`:

* Create a dynamics object with a model, hooks, and a convergence criterion.
* Call :meth:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics.run` — everything else
  happens automatically through the hook API.

**Part 1** — :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.optimizers.FIRE` geometry optimization.
A :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.ConvergenceHook` detects convergence
(fmax < 0.05) and fires an ``ON_CONVERGE`` hook; an ``AFTER_STEP`` hook logs
progress every N steps.

**Part 2** — A :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.FusedStage` that shares one
model forward pass across FIRE (status 0) and NVT Langevin MD (status 1).
The ``+`` operator composes the two sub-stages and auto-registers a
:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.ConvergenceHook` that migrates relaxed systems
from status 0 → 1.

.. note::

    :class:`~nvalchemi.models.demo.DemoModelWrapper` is used throughout.
    It supports conservative forces (via autograd) but not stresses, so
    variable-cell integrators are not shown here.

# Part 2: FusedStage — FIRE Relaxation → NVT Langevin MD
# --------------------------------------------------------
# A :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.FusedStage` composes sub-stages that
# share **one** model forward pass per step.  Each system carries a ``status``
# field that routes it to the corresponding sub-stage:
#
# * **status = 0** → processed by FIRE (relaxation phase)
# * **status = 1** → processed by NVTLangevin (MD sampling phase)
#
# The ``+`` operator creates the fused stage and auto-registers a
# :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.ConvergenceHook` on the FIRE sub-stage.
# That hook checks ``batch.fmax`` after each step and migrates systems that
# satisfy fmax < 0.05 from status 0 → 1.
#
# We register a ``ComputeFmaxHook`` at ``AFTER_COMPUTE`` on the FIRE sub-stage
# to keep ``batch.fmax`` current, since the auto-registered hook depends on it.
# A ``StatusLogHook`` at ``AFTER_STEP`` prints the status distribution and
# ``TransitionLogHook`` at ``ON_CONVERGE`` fires when FIRE detects relaxation.

Hooks — Core Framework
======================

The :mod:`nvalchemi.hooks` package provides the general-purpose hook
system used across all nvalchemi workflows (dynamics, training, custom
pipelines). It defines the protocol, context dataclasses, registry, and a set of
hooks that are useful regardless of the specific engine type.

.. seealso::

   - **User guide**: :ref:`hooks_guide` — conceptual overview and usage
     patterns.
   - **Dynamics hooks**: :ref:`dynamics-hooks` — hooks and stages
     specific to dynamics simulations.
   - **Training update hooks**: :ref:`training-update-hooks` — update-stage
     ownership, veto semantics, and constraints for training hooks.


The Hook protocol
-----------------

:class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.Hook` is a ``runtime_checkable``
:class:`~typing.Protocol`. Any object that exposes the three required
members — ``stage``, ``frequency``, and ``__call__`` — is a valid hook,
with no subclassing required:

.. code-block:: python

   from enum import Enum
   from nvalchemi.hooks import Hook, HookContext

   class MyHook:
       """A minimal custom hook — no inheritance required."""

       stage: Enum
       frequency: int = 1

       def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: Enum) -> None:
           print(f"graphs={ctx.batch.num_graphs}, stage={stage.name}")

Because ``Hook`` is a ``runtime_checkable`` ``Protocol``, you can also
use it as a type hint and check membership with ``isinstance``:

.. code-block:: python

   assert isinstance(MyHook(), Hook)  # True ✓

.. tip::

   **No subclassing required.** The protocol approach means any
   class---or even a frozen ``dataclass``---that provides
   ``frequency``, ``stage``, and ``__call__`` works as a hook.

:class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.CheckpointableHook` is a second, optional protocol for
hooks that own restart-critical runtime state. It requires ``state_dict()`` and
``load_state_dict()`` and is used by training checkpoints to persist only hooks
that explicitly opt in.


Context dataclasses
-------------------

Every hook receives a :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.HookContext` or a
workflow-specific subclass. The base dataclass contains only fields shared by
all hook-enabled engines; specialized contexts add fields that are meaningful
only for one workflow category.

     - Learning-rate schedulers.
   * - ``gradients``
     - ``dict[str, torch.Tensor] | None``
     - Parameter gradients.


Registration and dispatch
-------------------------

Hooks are registered either at construction or via ``register_hook()``.
The :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.HookRegistryMixin` provides flat-list
storage and dispatch logic for any engine.

.. code-block:: python

   # At construction (recommended for most cases)
   engine = MyEngine(hooks=[MyHook()])

   # Or register later
   engine.register_hook(AnotherHook())

At each stage, **all** registered hooks for that stage fire in
registration order, but only if ``step_count % hook.frequency == 0``.

The dispatch logic for each hook is:

1. If the hook defines ``_runs_on_stage(stage) -> bool``, call it.
2. Otherwise, check ``stage == hook.stage``.
3. If matched, call ``hook(ctx, stage)`` with a fresh context object.

.. note::

   At ``step_count == 0`` all hooks fire (since ``0 % n == 0`` for
   any ``n``), making step 0 a good point for initialization logic.


Task-category specialization
-----------------------------

The hook system supports multiple task categories through stage enums.
Each engine declares which stage types it accepts via ``_stage_type``.
For example:

- **Dynamics**: :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.DynamicsStage` — 9
  stages from ``BEFORE_STEP`` through ``ON_CONVERGE``.
- **Custom pipelines**: Any custom ``Enum`` type — the system accepts
  arbitrary enum types.

For multi-stage hooks, define a ``_runs_on_stage(stage) -> bool``
method. Hooks that need to support multiple enum types can use
`plum-dispatch <https://github.com/wesselb/plum>`_ to overload
``__call__``. See :ref:`hooks_guide` for full examples.


General-purpose hooks
---------------------

These hooks live in :mod:`nvalchemi.hooks` and work with any engine
that uses the hook system, not just dynamics.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Hook
     - Purpose
   * - :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.NeighborListHook`
     - Compute or refresh the neighbor list (``MATRIX`` or ``COO``
       format) with optional Verlet-skin buffering to skip redundant
       rebuilds. Fires at ``BEFORE_COMPUTE``.
   * - :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.BiasedPotentialHook`
     - Add an external bias potential (energy + forces) for enhanced
       sampling: umbrella sampling, metadynamics, steered MD, harmonic
       restraints, wall potentials.
   * - :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.WrapPeriodicHook`
     - Wrap atomic positions back into the unit cell under PBC.
       Fires at ``AFTER_POST_UPDATE``, respects per-system
       ``batch.pbc`` flags.

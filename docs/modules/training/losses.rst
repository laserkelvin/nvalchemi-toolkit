=======================
Losses — Training Terms
=======================

Composable, tensor-first loss functions for MLIP training.

.. seealso::

   - **User guide**: :ref:`losses_guide` — conceptual overview, usage
     patterns, and how to write your own loss term.


Leaf and composition
--------------------

Leaf losses subclass :class:`~nvalchemi.training.BaseLossFunction`;
compositions use :class:`~nvalchemi.training.ComposedLossFunction` and
return a :class:`~nvalchemi.training.ComposedLossOutput`.

Concrete losses
---------------

Built-in leaf losses for common quantum-chemistry targets.

   ForceLoss
   StressLoss


Weight schedules
----------------

Pydantic ``frozen`` models satisfying :class:`~nvalchemi.training.LossWeightSchedule`.

   ConstantWeight
   LinearWeight
   CosineWeight
   PiecewiseWeight


Reduction helpers
-----------------

Scatter-based per-graph reductions, importable for use in custom losses.

Training update hooks
=====================

Training update hooks are for policies that need to participate in the
weight-update portion of a training batch. They are intentionally narrower than
general :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.Hook` objects: a
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.TrainingUpdateHook` only runs on the stages
owned by :class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.TrainingUpdateOrchestrator`, and the
orchestrator performs the actual ``backward()``, optimizer step, scheduler step,
and gradient zeroing calls.

Use this hook family when multiple update policies need to coordinate around the
same batch update. Typical examples include gradient accumulation, mixed
precision, gradient clipping, spike skipping, and post-step model averaging.
Use a standard training hook for read-only observation or lifecycle logic that
does not need to own backward or optimizer-step behavior.

Fine-tuning helpers such as
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.ModulePatchHook` and
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.TrainableParameterHook` are
registration-time hooks. They adapt the model tree and optimizer parameter set
before training starts, but they do not own any batch update stages. See
:ref:`finetuning_guide` and :ref:`training-finetuning-api` for those workflows.

``ctx.step_count`` tracks completed optimizer/scheduler steps. If an update hook
vetoes ``DO_OPTIMIZER_STEP`` for gradient accumulation or spike skipping, the
batch still advances ``ctx.batch_count`` and ``ctx.epoch_step_count`` but does
not advance ``ctx.step_count``.

Distributed data parallel
-------------------------

:class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.DDPHook` wraps optimized models in
``torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`` during
``TrainingStage.SETUP``. This setup stage runs after distributed rank/device
resolution and before optimizer construction, so optimizers are built from the
DDP-wrapped model parameters.
See :ref:`distributed_manager_guide` for the workflow-level
``DistributedManager`` guide.

.. code-block:: python

   from nvalchemi.distributed import DistributedManager
   from nvalchemi.training.hooks import DDPHook, MixedPrecisionHook
   from nvalchemi.training.strategy import TrainingStrategy

   DistributedManager.initialize()
   manager = DistributedManager()

   strategy = TrainingStrategy(
       ...,
       distributed_manager=manager,
       hooks=[
           DDPHook(find_unused_parameters=False),
           MixedPrecisionHook(precision="bf16"),
       ],
   )

Launch single-node distributed training with ``torchrun``:

.. code-block:: bash

   torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 train.py

``DDPHook`` can also use ``TrainingStrategy.distributed_manager`` when a caller
provides a manager object. The recommended manager is
:class:`nvalchemi.distributed.DistributedManager`, which re-exports
``physicsnemo.distributed.DistributedManager``. Users should call
``DistributedManager.initialize()`` before constructing the manager. The hook
uses the manager's rank, world-size, local-rank, device, process group, and DDP
defaults such as ``broadcast_buffers`` and ``find_unused_parameters``. Without a
manager, the hook falls back to ``torch.distributed`` and torchrun environment
variables.

Sampler handling is automatic for supported dataloaders. For
``torch.utils.data.DataLoader``, the hook returns a replacement loader with a
configured sampler when one is not already present. The default sampler is
``torch.utils.data.DistributedSampler``; pass ``sampler_kwargs`` to override
its inferred ``rank``, ``num_replicas``, ``shuffle``, ``seed``, or
``drop_last`` arguments, or pass ``sampler_cls`` with ``sampler_kwargs`` to use
a custom distributed sampler. For
``nvalchemi.data.datapipes.DataLoader``, it mutates ``loader.sampler`` in place.
Custom ``batch_sampler`` instances must already be distributed-aware.
The strategy's epoch handling calls ``sampler.set_epoch(...)`` when available.

``DDPHook`` is not a training-update hook, so it does not participate in
``DO_BACKWARD`` or ``DO_OPTIMIZER_STEP``. Register it alongside
``MixedPrecisionHook`` normally; DDP wrapping happens before AMP opens its
per-batch autocast/update path.

Mixed precision
---------------

:class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.MixedPrecisionHook` enables
``torch.amp.autocast`` for the forward/loss portion of the batch and uses
``torch.amp.GradScaler`` when ``precision`` is ``torch.float16``. The
``precision`` argument is required so configs must choose one of the supported
policies explicitly:

.. code-block:: python

   import torch

   from nvalchemi.training.hooks import MixedPrecisionHook
   from nvalchemi.training.strategy import TrainingStrategy

   strategy = TrainingStrategy(
       ...,
       hooks=[MixedPrecisionHook(precision=torch.bfloat16)],
   )

``precision`` accepts the dtype objects ``torch.float32``, ``torch.bfloat16``,
and ``torch.float16``, the canonical strings ``"float32"``, ``"bfloat16"``,
and ``"float16"``, or the shorthand aliases ``"fp32"``, ``"bf16"``, and
``"fp16"``.

The policies are:

* ``torch.float32``: no autocast context is created and no scaler is used.
* ``torch.bfloat16``: eligible ops run under bf16 autocast and no scaler is used.
* ``torch.float16``: eligible forward/loss ops run under fp16 autocast, the hook
  scales the loss before backward, unscales gradients immediately before an
  optimizer step proceeds, and lets the scaler skip steps with ``inf`` or
  ``nan`` gradients.

Register at most one ``MixedPrecisionHook`` per strategy. The strategy rejects
multiple mixed-precision hooks so that autocast, loss scaling, unscale, scaler
step, and scaler update cannot be applied twice in one batch update.

Autocast scope
--------------

Autocast begins from the update-hook ``BEFORE_BATCH`` stage and is released
before ``backward()`` during ``DO_BACKWARD``. In normal strategy execution, that
covers the model forward and configured loss calculation while keeping backward
outside autocast. ``torch.float32`` is a no-op policy and does not create an
autocast context. Model wrappers or custom losses that need full precision for
a numerically sensitive subregion should open a local
``torch.amp.autocast(..., enabled=False)`` block or choose ``torch.float32`` /
``torch.bfloat16`` for the strategy.

Gradient accumulation
---------------------

With fp16 gradient scaling, accumulated gradients stay scaled until the
effective batch is ready to step. A gradient-accumulation update hook should
veto ``TrainingStage.DO_OPTIMIZER_STEP`` on intermediate microbatches; that
suppresses AMP unscale, scaler step, and scaler update for those batches. When
the accumulation window is complete, the optimizer-step stage proceeds and
``MixedPrecisionHook`` unscales once per optimizer just before stepping.

The scaler path has a small fast path when no schedulers are configured:
``GradScaler.step`` and ``GradScaler.update`` are sufficient. When schedulers are
present, the orchestrator checks whether each scaler step was skipped so it can
advance only schedulers whose paired optimizer actually stepped.

Validation
----------

``MixedPrecisionHook`` is tied to the training update path owned by
``TrainingStrategy``. Validation is first-class on the strategy:
``TrainingStrategy.validate()`` (driven by a :class:`~nvalchemi.training.ValidationConfig`)
automatically honors a registered ``MixedPrecisionHook``'s inference autocast
according to the config's ``use_mixed_precision`` policy, so no separate
validation hook is required. The standalone
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.ValidationLoop` is hook-agnostic and instead takes
an explicit ``autocast`` callable. See :doc:`validation`.

Stage constraints
-----------------

Training update hooks always receive ``(ctx, stage, will_skip)`` and return
``(proceed, loss)``. The meaning of those values depends on the stage:

.. list-table:: Training update hook stage contract
   :widths: 18 22 22 38
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Stage
     - Hook responsibility
     - Return contract
     - Restrictions and expectations
   * - ``BEFORE_BATCH``
     - Decide whether the orchestrator should call
       :func:`~nvalchemi.training.optimizers.zero_gradients`.
     - ``proceed`` must be a strict ``bool``. Any ``False`` vetoes gradient
       zeroing. ``loss`` is ignored.
     - Do not call ``backward()``, ``optimizer.step()``, or
       ``scheduler.step()``. Use this stage for zero-grad policy, per-batch
       update bookkeeping, or resetting state that is safe before the forward
       pass.
   * - ``DO_BACKWARD``
     - Transform or replace ``ctx.loss`` before the orchestrator calls
       ``backward()`` once.
     - ``loss`` must be a :class:`torch.Tensor`. ``proceed`` is ignored.
     - Do not call ``backward()`` directly. Return the loss tensor the next
       update hook should see. This is the stage for loss scaling and other
       loss-space transforms.
   * - ``DO_OPTIMIZER_STEP``
     - Decide whether the orchestrator should call
       :func:`~nvalchemi.training.optimizers.step_optimizers` and
       :func:`~nvalchemi.training.optimizers.step_lr_schedulers`.
     - ``proceed`` must be a strict ``bool``. Any ``False`` vetoes both the
       optimizer and scheduler step. ``loss`` is ignored.
     - Do not call ``backward()``. Avoid side effects that assume a step will
       run when ``will_skip`` is ``True``. This is the stage for pre-step logic
       such as gradient clipping, scaler updates, and accumulation/spike-skip
       decisions.
   * - ``AFTER_OPTIMIZER_STEP``
     - Observe the final step decision and run post-step bookkeeping.
     - ``proceed`` and ``loss`` are ignored. ``will_skip`` tells the hook
       whether the optimizer/scheduler step was vetoed.
     - Do not call ``backward()`` or perform another optimizer/scheduler step.
       Use this stage for work that should happen after the step path, such as
       EMA updates, diagnostics, and state cleanup.

Composition rules
-----------------

All update hooks for a strategy are composed into one orchestrator. Lower
``priority`` values run first, and registration order breaks ties. The
orchestrator keeps calling later hooks after a veto so they can observe
``will_skip=True`` and update their own state consistently.

Only one object may own ``DO_BACKWARD`` or ``DO_OPTIMIZER_STEP`` in a
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.strategy.TrainingStrategy`. For convenience, the
strategy auto-wraps bare :class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.TrainingUpdateHook`
instances into one :class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.TrainingUpdateOrchestrator`.
Passing ``stage=...`` while registering an update hook is not supported because
update hooks declare their stages through the orchestrator.

EMA model averaging
-------------------

:class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.EMAHook` maintains an
``AveragedModel`` for one model in ``ctx.models``. It runs during
``AFTER_OPTIMIZER_STEP`` and updates only after a successful optimizer step. If
an earlier update hook vetoes ``DO_OPTIMIZER_STEP``, the orchestrator passes
``will_skip=True`` and the EMA weights are left unchanged for that batch.

.. code-block:: python

   from nvalchemi.training.hooks import EMAHook
   from nvalchemi.training.strategy import TrainingStrategy

   ema = EMAHook(model_key="main", decay=0.999)
   strategy = TrainingStrategy(..., hooks=[ema])

Restartable update hooks
------------------------

Most hooks should not write checkpoint state. If a training hook owns state
that changes resumed training behavior, such as EMA averaged weights or a
learned/adaptive update policy, make it satisfy
:class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.CheckpointableHook`. The strategy checkpoint loader
restores state only into runtime hooks that implement this specialized
protocol.

For Pydantic hooks, keep constructor/configuration fields on the model and use
``model_dump()`` inside ``state_dict()`` before adding non-field runtime state:

.. code-block:: python

   from collections.abc import Mapping
   from typing import Any

   import torch
   from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, PrivateAttr

   from nvalchemi.hooks import CheckpointableHook
   from nvalchemi.training import TrainingStage
   from nvalchemi.training.hooks import TrainingUpdateHook

   class RestartableMetricHook(BaseModel, TrainingUpdateHook):
       update_every: int = Field(gt=0, default=1)
       num_updates: int = 0

       _metric_total: torch.Tensor | None = PrivateAttr(default=None)

       def __call__(self, ctx, stage, will_skip):
           if (
               stage is TrainingStage.AFTER_OPTIMIZER_STEP
               and not will_skip
               and ctx.loss is not None
           ):
               value = ctx.loss.detach().to("cpu")
               self._metric_total = (
                   value
                   if self._metric_total is None
                   else self._metric_total + value
               )
               self.num_updates += 1
           return True, ctx.loss

       def state_dict(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
           state = self.model_dump()
           if self._metric_total is not None:
               state["metric_total"] = self._metric_total
           return state

       def load_state_dict(self, state: Mapping[str, Any]) -> None:
           if state.get("update_every", self.update_every) != self.update_every:
               raise ValueError("RestartableMetricHook config mismatch")
           self.num_updates = int(state.get("num_updates", self.num_updates))
           self._metric_total = state.get("metric_total")

   assert isinstance(RestartableMetricHook(), CheckpointableHook)

Use ``model_dump_json()`` for JSON configuration records or diagnostics, not for
tensor-bearing checkpoint state. Tensor state should remain in ``state_dict()``
so the checkpoint layer can save it with the rest of the training state.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

   import torch

   from nvalchemi.training import TrainingStage
   from nvalchemi.training.hooks import TrainingUpdateHook

   class ClipGradients(TrainingUpdateHook):
       priority = 30

       def __init__(self, max_norm: float) -> None:
           self.max_norm = max_norm

       def __call__(self, ctx, stage, will_skip):
           match stage:
               case TrainingStage.DO_OPTIMIZER_STEP:
                   if not will_skip:
                       for optimizer in ctx.optimizers:
                           params = (
                               param
                               for group in optimizer.param_groups
                               for param in group["params"]
                           )
                           torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(params, self.max_norm)
               case _:
                   pass
           return True, ctx.loss

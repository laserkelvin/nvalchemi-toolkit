# Hooks

Hooks let you observe or modify workflow state at specific points in any
engine's execution loop—dynamics simulations, training loops, or custom
pipelines—without touching the engine code itself. They are the primary
extension mechanism for logging, convergence checking, trajectory recording,
and any custom per-step logic.

## The Hook protocol

A hook is any object that satisfies the
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.Hook` protocol (a
`@runtime_checkable` `Protocol`). The required interface is:

| Attribute / Method | Type | Purpose |
|--------------------|------|---------|
| `stage` | `Enum` | Which stage of the execution loop this hook fires at (e.g. `DynamicsStage`, `TrainingStage`) |
| `frequency` | `int` | Execute every *n* steps (1 = every step) |
| `__call__(ctx, stage)` | `None` | The hook's logic, called with a {py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.HookContext` and the current stage |

The `Hook` protocol lives in {py:mod}`nvalchemi.hooks` and is
stage-enum agnostic — the same protocol works for dynamics, training,
or any custom workflow.

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import Hook, HookContext
from nvalchemi.dynamics.base import DynamicsStage

class MyHook:
    stage = DynamicsStage.AFTER_STEP
    frequency = 1

    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: DynamicsStage) -> None:
        print(f"Step {ctx.step_count}: energy = {ctx.batch.energies.mean():.4f}")

assert isinstance(MyHook(), Hook)  # True — structural subtyping
```

Hooks are attached at construction time via the `hooks` parameter:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics import FIRE, ConvergenceHook
from nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks import LoggingHook

opt = FIRE(
    model=model,
    dt=0.1,
    n_steps=500,
    hooks=[
        ConvergenceHook(fmax=0.05),
        LoggingHook(interval=10),
    ],
)
```

During each `step()`, the engine iterates over hooks and calls those whose
`stage` matches the current point in the loop and whose `frequency` divides the
current step count.

```{tip}
A ``Hook`` is implemented as a Python ``Protocol``, which represents structural
subtyping: for those wanting to write custom ``Hook``s,
it's not necessary to subclass the base ``Hook``, providing that your
custom class contains the same attributes and methods---as long as it
quacks like a duck.
```

## HookContext

Every hook receives a {py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.HookContext` object that
provides a unified snapshot of the current workflow state:

| Field | Type | Populated by |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `batch` | `Batch` | All engines |
| `step_count` | `int` | All engines |
| `model` | `BaseModelMixin \| None` | All engines |
| `loss` | `torch.Tensor \| None` | Training only |
| `optimizer` | `torch.optim.Optimizer \| None` | Training only |
| `lr_scheduler` | `object \| None` | Training only |
| `gradients` | `dict[str, torch.Tensor] \| None` | Training only |
| `converged_mask` | `torch.Tensor \| None` | Dynamics only |
| `epoch` | `int \| None` | Training only |
| `global_rank` | `int` | All engines (distributed) |

The engine builds this context object at each stage via an overridable
`_build_context(batch)` method, so each engine type populates the fields
relevant to its workflow.

### Optional context manager support

Hooks may optionally implement `__enter__` and `__exit__`. If present, the dynamics
engine calls them when the simulation starts and ends (or when using the dynamics
object as a context manager). This is useful for hooks that manage resources like
open files or logger instances --- for example,
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.LoggingHook` uses this to set up and tear down
its logger.

## Task-category specialization

The hook system supports multiple **task categories** through stage enums:

- **Dynamics**: {py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.DynamicsStage` — 9 stages from
  `BEFORE_STEP` through `ON_CONVERGE`
- **Training**: {py:class}`~nvalchemi.training.TrainingStage` — 12 stages from
  `BEFORE_EPOCH` through `ON_CONVERGE`

Each engine declares which stage enum type(s) it accepts via
{py:attr}`~nvalchemi.hooks.HookRegistryMixin._stage_type`. For example,
`BaseDynamics` sets `_stage_type = DynamicsStage`, so registering a hook
with `stage = TrainingStage.BEFORE_BATCH` raises `TypeError`.

A hook that needs to work across *multiple* task categories can use
[plum-dispatch](https://github.com/wesselb/plum) to overload
`__call__` for each stage enum type. The `@dispatch` decorator selects
the correct overload at runtime based on the concrete `Enum` subclass
passed by the engine. Two things are needed beyond `@dispatch`:

- A `_runs_on_stage` method so the registry knows the hook fires at
  more than just `self.stage`.
- A fallback overload typed as `Enum` for any stage type not explicitly
  handled.

The built-in {py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.ProfilerHook` uses
exactly this pattern. Here is a simplified version:

```python
from enum import Enum
from plum import dispatch

from nvalchemi.hooks import HookContext
from nvalchemi.dynamics.base import DynamicsStage
from nvalchemi.training import TrainingStage

class ShareableHook:
    stage = DynamicsStage.AFTER_STEP  # primary stage (protocol compliance)
    frequency = 10

    def __init__(self):
        self._stages = {DynamicsStage.AFTER_STEP, TrainingStage.AFTER_BATCH}

    def _runs_on_stage(self, stage: Enum) -> bool:
        return stage in self._stages

    @dispatch
    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: DynamicsStage) -> None:
        """Dynamics-specific logic."""
        fmax = ctx.batch.forces.norm(dim=-1).max().item()
        print(f"[dynamics] step {ctx.step_count}: fmax={fmax:.4f}")

    @dispatch
    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: TrainingStage) -> None:
        """Training-specific logic."""
        if ctx.loss is not None:
            print(f"[training] step {ctx.step_count}: loss={ctx.loss.item():.6f}")

    @dispatch
    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: Enum) -> None:
        """Fallback for unknown stage types."""
        print(f"[custom] step {ctx.step_count}: {stage.name}")
```

## Built-in hooks

### ConvergenceHook

{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.ConvergenceHook` evaluates one or more
convergence criteria at each step and marks systems as converged when **all** of
them are satisfied (AND semantics).

The simplest way to create one is with the convenience classmethods:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics import ConvergenceHook

# Check whether fmax (pre-computed scalar on the batch) is below a threshold
hook = ConvergenceHook.from_fmax(threshold=0.05)

# Or check per-atom force norms directly (applies a norm reduction internally)
hook = ConvergenceHook.from_forces(threshold=0.05)
```

#### Multiple criteria

When a single scalar is not enough, pass a list of criterion specifications.
Each entry is a dictionary with the fields of the internal
`_ConvergenceCriterion` model:

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `key` | `str` | *(required)* | Tensor key to read from the batch |
| `threshold` | `float` | *(required)* | Values at or below this are converged |
| `reduce_op` | `"min"` / `"max"` / `"norm"` / `"mean"` / `"sum"` / `None` | `None` | Reduction applied within each entry before graph-level aggregation |
| `reduce_dims` | `int` or `list[int]` | `-1` | Dimensions to reduce over |
| `custom_op` | callable or `None` | `None` | Custom function `Tensor -> Bool[B]`; when set, the other fields are ignored |

```python
hook = ConvergenceHook(criteria=[
    {"key": "fmax", "threshold": 0.05},
    {"key": "energy_change", "threshold": 1e-6},
])
```

All criteria must be satisfied for a system to converge. If you omit `criteria`
entirely, the hook defaults to a single `fmax < 0.05` criterion.

#### How evaluation works under the hood

For each criterion the hook:

1. Retrieves the tensor from the batch via its `key`.
2. If `reduce_op` is set, reduces within each entry (e.g. force vector norm).
3. If the tensor is node-level (first dim matches `num_nodes`), scatter-reduces to
   graph-level using the batch index.
4. Compares the resulting per-graph scalar against `threshold`.

The per-criterion boolean masks are stacked into a `(num_criteria, B)` tensor and
AND-reduced across criteria to produce a single `(B,)` convergence mask.

#### Status migration in multi-stage pipelines

When `source_status` and `target_status` are provided, the hook updates
`batch.status` for converged systems --- this is how
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.FusedStage` moves systems between stages:

```python
hook = ConvergenceHook(
    criteria=[{"key": "fmax", "threshold": 0.05}],
    source_status=0,   # only check systems currently in stage 0
    target_status=1,    # promote converged systems to stage 1
)
```

In a single-stage simulation (no status arguments), convergence simply causes
those systems to stop being updated.

### LoggingHook

{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.LoggingHook` records scalar observables
(energy, temperature, maximum force, etc.) at a configurable interval:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks import LoggingHook

hook = LoggingHook(interval=10)  # log every 10 steps
```

The hook implements the context manager protocol to manage its logger lifecycle.

### SnapshotHook

{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.SnapshotHook` saves the full batch state to a
[data sink](dynamics_sinks_guide) at regular intervals. This is how you record
trajectories:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks import SnapshotHook
from nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks import ZarrData

hook = SnapshotHook(
    sink=ZarrData("/path/to/trajectory.zarr"),
    interval=50,  # save every 50 steps
)
```

### ConvergedSnapshotHook

{py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.ConvergedSnapshotHook` is a specialised variant
that only saves systems at the moment they satisfy their convergence criterion. This
is useful for collecting relaxed structures from a large batch without storing the
full trajectory:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks import ConvergedSnapshotHook
from nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks import ZarrData

hook = ConvergedSnapshotHook(sink=ZarrData("/path/to/relaxed.zarr"))
```

## Writing a custom hook

### Simple dynamics hook

To write your own hook, create a class that implements the three required members
(`stage`, `frequency`, `__call__`). The `__call__` method receives a
{py:class}`~nvalchemi.hooks.HookContext` and the current stage:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics.base import DynamicsStage
from nvalchemi.hooks import HookContext

class PrintFmaxHook:
    stage = DynamicsStage.AFTER_STEP
    frequency = 1

    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: DynamicsStage) -> None:
        fmax = ctx.batch.forces.norm(dim=-1).max().item()
        print(f"Step {ctx.step_count}: fmax = {fmax:.4f} eV/A")
```

### Hook for a different task category

The same protocol works for training hooks — just use `TrainingStage`:

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import HookContext
from nvalchemi.training._stages import TrainingStage

class GradNormLogger:
    stage = TrainingStage.AFTER_BACKWARD
    frequency = 1

    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: TrainingStage) -> None:
        if ctx.gradients:
            total_norm = sum(g.norm().item() for g in ctx.gradients.values())
            print(f"Step {ctx.step_count}: grad norm = {total_norm:.4f}")
```

### Multi-stage hooks with `_runs_on_stage`

A hook can fire at multiple stages by defining a `_runs_on_stage` method.
The registry calls this instead of comparing `stage == hook.stage`:

```python
from enum import Enum
from nvalchemi.dynamics.base import DynamicsStage
from nvalchemi.hooks import HookContext

class StepTimerHook:
    stage = DynamicsStage.BEFORE_STEP  # primary stage (for protocol compliance)
    frequency = 1

    def __init__(self):
        self._stages = {DynamicsStage.BEFORE_STEP, DynamicsStage.AFTER_STEP}
        self._t0 = None

    def _runs_on_stage(self, stage: Enum) -> bool:
        return stage in self._stages

    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: DynamicsStage) -> None:
        import time
        if stage == DynamicsStage.BEFORE_STEP:
            self._t0 = time.perf_counter()
        elif stage == DynamicsStage.AFTER_STEP and self._t0 is not None:
            dt = time.perf_counter() - self._t0
            print(f"Step {ctx.step_count}: {dt*1000:.1f} ms")
```

### Cross-category hooks with `plum` dispatch

For hooks that work across multiple task categories (e.g. dynamics *and*
training), use `plum.dispatch` to overload `__call__` with different stage
types. This lets you customize behavior per category:

```python
from enum import Enum
from plum import dispatch
from nvalchemi.dynamics.base import DynamicsStage
from nvalchemi.hooks import HookContext
from nvalchemi.training._stages import TrainingStage

class UniversalLoggerHook:
    stage = DynamicsStage.AFTER_STEP  # primary stage
    frequency = 10

    def __init__(self):
        self._stages = {DynamicsStage.AFTER_STEP, TrainingStage.AFTER_BATCH}

    def _runs_on_stage(self, stage: Enum) -> bool:
        return stage in self._stages

    @dispatch
    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: DynamicsStage) -> None:
        fmax = ctx.batch.forces.norm(dim=-1).max().item()
        print(f"[dynamics] step {ctx.step_count}: fmax={fmax:.4f}")

    @dispatch
    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: TrainingStage) -> None:
        if ctx.loss is not None:
            print(f"[training] step {ctx.step_count}: loss={ctx.loss.item():.6f}")

    @dispatch
    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: Enum) -> None:
        print(f"[custom] step {ctx.step_count}: stage={stage.name}")
```

The built-in {py:class}`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.ProfilerHook` uses this
pattern to instrument both dynamics and training workflows with appropriate
NVTX domain annotations.

### Resource management with `__enter__` / `__exit__`

If your hook needs setup or teardown (e.g. opening a file), add `__enter__` and
`__exit__`:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics.base import DynamicsStage
from nvalchemi.hooks import HookContext

class FileWriterHook:
    stage = DynamicsStage.AFTER_STEP
    frequency = 10

    def __init__(self, path):
        self.path = path
        self._file = None

    def __enter__(self):
        self._file = open(self.path, "w")
        return self

    def __call__(self, ctx: HookContext, stage: DynamicsStage) -> None:
        energy = ctx.batch.energies.mean().item()
        self._file.write(f"{ctx.step_count},{energy}\n")

    def __exit__(self, *exc):
        if self._file is not None:
            self._file.close()
```

## Composing hooks

Hooks are independent and composable. A typical production setup combines
convergence, logging, and trajectory recording:

```python
from nvalchemi.dynamics import FIRE
from nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks import (
    ConvergenceHook,
    ConvergedSnapshotHook,
    LoggingHook,
    SnapshotHook,
)
from nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks import ZarrData

with FIRE(
    model=model,
    dt=0.1,
    n_steps=500,
    hooks=[
        ConvergenceHook(fmax=0.05),
        LoggingHook(interval=10),
        SnapshotHook(sink=ZarrData("/tmp/traj.zarr"), interval=50),
        ConvergedSnapshotHook(sink=ZarrData("/tmp/relaxed.zarr")),
    ],
) as opt:
    relaxed = opt.run(batch)
```
